# Quickview Analysis of TELL Load Duration Curve Variability
>
## Purpose
This analysis looks at the interannual variability in the load duration curve (LDC) for each Balancing Authority (BA) 
and state simulated by the TELL model.
>
## Notes
>
1. Right now the plots are set to focus on the highest 168 hours (7 days) of load for each BA and state. This helps to
demonstrate variability in peak loads.
