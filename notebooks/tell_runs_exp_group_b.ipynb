    "\n",
    "The Total ELectricity Load (TELL) model projects the short- and long-term evoluation of hourly electricity demand (load) in response to future changes in weather and climate. The purpose of `tell` is to generate end-of-century hourly profiles of electricity demand across the entire Conterminous United States (CONUS) at a spatial resolution adequate for input to a unit commitment/economic dispatch (UC/ED) model while also maintaining consistency with the long-term growth and evolution of annual state-level electricity demand projected by an economically driven human-Earth system model. `tell` takes as input future projections of the hourly time-series of meteorology and decadal populations and uses the temporal variations in weather to project hourly profiles of total electricity demand. The core predictions in `tell` are based on a series of multilayer perceptron (MLP) models for individual Balancing Authorities (BAs). Those MLP models are trained on historical observations of weather and electricity demand. Hourly projections from `tell` are scaled to match the annual state-level total electricity loads projected by the U.S. version of the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM-USA). GCAM-USA captures the long-term co-evolution of the human-Earth system. Using this unique approach allows `tell` to reflect both changes in the shape of the load profile due to variations in weather and the long-term evolution of energy demand due to changes in population, technology, and economics. `tell` is unique from other load forecasting models in that it features an explicit spatial component that allows us to relate projected loads to where they would occur spatially within a grid operations model. The output of `tell` is a series of hourly projections for future electricity demand at the county, state, and BA scale that are quantitatively and conceptually consistent with one another. More information about how the model works and how it can be applied are available on the [Read the Docs](https://immm-sfa.github.io/tell/) site for `tell`.\n",

    "This section of the notebook takes the data processed in the `tell_data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook and trains a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model for each of the 54 BAs in `tell`. The MLP models use temporal variations in weather to project hourly demand. More information about this approach is in the MLP section of the `tell` [User Guide](https://immm-sfa.github.io/tell/user_guide.html). We include pre-trained models within the `tell` repository. If you want to explore the model training aspect you can use the code in Section 3.1 to retrain the MLP models for a single BA or a batch of BAs. Note that since the `save_model` parameter is set to false by default running these training steps will not overwrite the models included in `tell`. If you want to skip this step you can move to Section 3.2 to see how `tell` projects future loads by BA using weather projections.\n",

    "The first step is to train the MLP models using the historical weather and load datasets. The default settings for the MLP model training steps are included in the `mlp_settings.yml` file included in the data folder of the `tell` repository. By default the MLP models are trained on data from 2016-2018 and evaluated using data from 2019. The time windows for training and evaluating the models can be modified by altering the `start_time`, `end_time`, and `split_datetime` parameters when calling the `tell.train` function. The first code block shows how to train the MLP models for a single BA. We also include a function to do some basic analysis of the trained model's performance. More extensive evaluation of the `tell` predictive models is included in the `tell_mlp_calibration_evaluation.ipynb` notebook.
