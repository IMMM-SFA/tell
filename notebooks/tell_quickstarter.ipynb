    "\n",
    "The Total ELectricity Load (TELL) model projects the short- and long-term evoluation of hourly electricity demand in response to future climate and population changes. The purpose of `tell` is to generate end-of-century hourly profiles of electricity demand across the entire United States (U.S.) at a spatial resolution adequate for input to a unit commitment/economic dispatch (UC/ED) model while also maintaining consistency with the long-term growth and evolution of annual state-level electricity demand projected by an economically driven human-Earth system model. `tell` takes as input future projections of the hourly time-series of meteorology and decadal populations and uses the temporal variations in weather to project hourly profiles of total electricity demand. The core predictions in `tell` are based on a series of multilayer perceptron (MLP) models for individual Balancing Authorities (BAs). Those MLP models are trained on historical observations of weather and electricity demand. Hourly projections from `tell` are scaled to match the annual state-level total electricity loads projected by the U.S. version of the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM-USA). GCAM-USA captures the long-term co-evolution of the human-Earth system. Using this unique approach allows `tell` to reflect both changes in the shape of the load profile due to variations in weather and the long-term evolution of energy demand due to changes in population, technology, and economics. `tell` is unique from other probabilistic load forecasting models in that it features an explicit spatial component that allows us to relate projected loads to where they would occur spatially within a grid operations model. The output of `tell` is a series of hourly projections for future electricity demand at the county, state, and BA scale that are quantitatively and conceptually consistent with one another. More information about how the model works and how it can be fully applied are available on the [Read the Docs](https://immm-sfa.github.io/tell/index.html) site for `tell`.\n",

    "The final section of this quickstarter notebook plots some of the output of `tell` to give the user a flavor of what the model is doing. Because `tell` can take a few minutes to run we have pre-ran the model for the sample weather years described above. The first step in this section downloads that sample `tell` output data package from the [Zenodo data package](https://zenodo.org/record/6338472#.YieU0BPMJTY) and then visualizes the output in multiple ways. Note that the sample output data covers the years 2039, 2059, 2079, and 2099 so those are the only valid values for the \"year_to_plot\" variable in each function call."
