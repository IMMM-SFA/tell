    "# Welcome to the TELL Quickstarter! \n",
    "\n",
    "### **`tell` is an open-source Python package for predicting future electricty load in the Lower 48 United States.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## A little about `tell`\n",
    "\n",
    "The Total ELectricity Load (TELL) model provides a framework that integrates aspects of both short- and long-term predictions of electricity demand in a coherent and scalable way. `tell` takes as input gridded hourly time-series of meteorology and uses the temporal variations in weather to predict hourly profiles of total electricity demand for every county in the lower 48 United States using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) approach. Hourly predictions from `tell` are then scaled to match the annual state-level total electricity loads predicted by the U.S. version of the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM-USA). GCAM-USA is designed to capture the long-term co-evolution of the human-Earth system. Using this unique approach allows tell to reflect both changes in the shape of the load profile due to variations in weather and climate and the long-term evolution of energy demand due to changes in population, technology, and economics. `tell` is unique from other probabilistic load forecasting models in that it features an explicit spatial component that allows us to relate predicted loads to where they would occur spatially within a grid operations model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lets get started! \n",
    "\n",
    "In this quickstarter we will walk through a subset of the data used in `tell`, starting with importing the package and ending with data visualization. This allows the user to walk through the entire `tell` package in a matter of minutes. If you have more questions please feel free to visit the [Read the Docs](https://immm-sfa.github.io/tell/index.html) site for `tell`.\n",
