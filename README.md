## TELL
>
The TELL model will generate predictions of hourly total electricity load for every county in the Continental United States (CONUS). Predictions from TELL will be scaled to match the annual state-level total electricity loads predicted by the U.S. version of the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM-USA).

## How to Run TELL
1. Download the input data from PNNL's Institutional Computing (PIC) to your local machine<sup>*</sup>:
>
    sftp username@constance.pnl.gov
    cd /projects/im3/tell
    get -r inputs
    get -r raw_data
>
2. Set 'input_data_directory' to point to the directory where you downloaded the data.
>
3. 


<sup>* </sup>Note that this step will eventually be replaced with instructions for downloading the input dataset from a data repository once the data packaged is finalized.
