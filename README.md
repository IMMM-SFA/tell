# TELL
The TELL model will generate predictions of hourly total electricity load for every county in the Continental United States (CONUS). Predictions from TELL will be scaled to match the annual state-level total electricity loads predicted by the U.S. version of the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM-USA).

## Examples
Need examples on how to run TELL
