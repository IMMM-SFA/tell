## tell

#### `tell` is an open-source Python package to model future hourly total electricity loads.

### Purpose
`tell` was created to:

  - Project the short- and long-term evolution of hourly electricity demand in response to changes in weather and climate.

  - Work at a spatial resolution adequate for input to a unit commitment/economic dispatch (UC/ED) model.

  - Maintain consistency with the long-term growth and evolution of annual state-level electricity demand projected by an economically driven human-Earth system model.

### Install `tell`

```bash
pip install tell
